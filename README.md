- Learned about display element: in-line block element, block element, and in-line element

UPDATE:

I haven't been updating this much as I have not been learning or working on HTML and CSS. Unfortunately, I've been working on classwork for school and it has been taking a toll. However, I will make sure to update this sooner and continue from where I left off.

-Day 6:

- Learned about HTML semantics
- Learned how to make forms and tables
