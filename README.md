# webdev-journey
Documenting my journey learning web development, and key programming fundamentals.


Day 1:

- Learned elements like button, p, a. AND href = ""  target = "_blank" (attribute: this can link other websites. set href equal to link. Target just sends us to the link but in another tab) 

- Learned about CSS <style>
- Learned about class in elements
- Learned about box-shadows, transitions, opacity (0-1),  hover + active pseudo class

Day 2: 

- Learned about different font styles, padding + margins. 
- Learned about the strong, u, and span element.
- Text alignment, colors, etc. 
- Made silly mistakes like spelling errors
- learned how to add fonts from google.

Day 3:

- Learned about images, text boxes, check boxes, and attributes
- Learned about display element: in-line block element, block element, and in-line element
- Learned about the div element (basically a container)


Day 4:

- Learned about CSS grid. (I struggled to understand it at first, however, with guidance and a little bit of testing, I was able to grasp the concept and how it worked)
- justify-content, align-content, justify-items, align-items.

Day 5:

-Learned about flexbox and the many properties.
- Added a folder to day 5 of a nav bar using flex.
- Played around with transitions and tranformation.

UPDATE:

I haven't been updating this much as I have not been learning or working on HTML and CSS. Unfortunately, I've been working on classwork for school and it has been taking a toll. However, I will make sure to update this sooner and continue from where I left off.

Day 6:

- Learned about HTML semantics
- Learned how to make forms and tables
- Also learned about accesibility (helps users with disability and allow access for all types of people)

Day 7:

- Practicing with lists and links
- Learned about link-style property
- Created a "To-Play List"
- Also learned about background gradient and the syntax 

Day 8:

- Dove deeper into absolute and relative units
- Learned about absolute units such as px, cm, mm
- Learned about relative units such as em(based on parent's font size), rem(based on root element's font size), percentages(based on parent's dimensions).
- Created a fictional flyer (in day 8 folder)

Day 9:

(I Will be changing the format of the following days of this dev-log. It will be in a format including: The Date, What I learned, Problems/Challenges that occured, and other revelant things)

1/27/2026

What I've Learned:

- I dove deeper into psuedo-classes such as :hover, :active, :visited, etc..
- I learned about psuedo-elements such as ::after(adding content after element), ::before(adding content before element), etc...
- Created a happy birthday card(will be added today 9 folder)

  
Problems/Challenges:

- I still suck with units of measurements and such, however, I am starting to understand and master selectivity and psuedo-classes.

Other:

- I also touched on the transition and transform property.

Day 10:

1/29/2008

What I've Learned:

- I practiced more psuedo classes working on a lab on freecodecamp.org
- With the guidance of freecodecamp, I was able to create a mini little job application form (can be seen in day 10 folders) *It is not an app, it is just a practice. All credits goes to freecodecamp.org*

Problems/Challenges:
- I was really taking a long time to apply pseudo classes to elements individually, however, I figured out you can just write them on the same line.
- I didn't know how to change color of the label of a input type radio, however, with the assistant of AI, I was able to figure it out.

Others:
-AI can be a very useful tool and I will be using it more often for teaching and assistance. 


Day 11:


1/30/2026

What I've learned:

- I practiced with some colors and forms.
- Dove deeper into color theory and making websites like visually appealing
- Created a issue-report form (can be found in day 11 folder) *lab from freecodecamp, it was practice*

Problems/Challenges:
- Color theory and making websites visually appealing takes time, and you need to know what kind of tone or feeling you want to set. 

Other: 
- Make sure to trust the process
